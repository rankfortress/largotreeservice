	How much does it cost to cut down a tree? ​There are several factors that come into play when figuring the cost to remove a tree such as the height of the tree, diameter and the species, as some types are much more difficult to remove than others.All things considered, according to statistics, "cutting down and removing a tree costs an average of $400 to $1,200 with most paying $750. Extreme projects might hit $2,000 with the low end of small trees only costing $200. You’ll pay $8 to $15 per foot with the range coming from cost factors like accessibility and job complexity. Most pros charge different rates for different height ranges."
	
	So cost can vary from $400 to $2000 or more depending on the size of the job, equipment and crew needed. Can you remove a tree yourself? Of course you may be able to but that's definitely not the smartest decision as many injuries even deaths have occurred when amateurs try daring and daunting tasks like these themselves.
